# Project #1: Tic Tac Toe

## Overview:

This is a game of tic tac toe.

## Technology used:
I used javascript, css and html.

## Technical Requirements
* [X]Render a game board in the browser
* [X]Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* [X]Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
* [X]Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* [X]Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* [X]Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
* [X]Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* [X]You can use GitHub Pages for deploying your project #I used Netlify
* [X]Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* [X]Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

User Stories
* [X]As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
* [X]As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
* [X]As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
* [X]As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
* [X]As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
* [X]As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
* [X]As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

Presentation
What would you do differently?

Less code. I may have over-complicated it.
MVC would have been a good model.
What are you most proud of?

The two arrays to track user moves.
What would you do next?

Probably another refactor.
The 2d (nested) array matrix
How did you plan your project?

I used the userstories provided to drive the process.
I tried a few things out that I haven't played with much before
Tried passing data in from node.
Tried a Class based approach with js.
What did you learn?

Stay simple.
JS's classes are weird.
A pen-and-paper is handy when working through problems.
